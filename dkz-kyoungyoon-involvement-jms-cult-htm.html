The interviews' purpose was to allow Kyoungyoon, and his family admit their affiliation with the church, as well as reflect on their experiences.</p><p>In relation to Kyoungyoon's issue, Netflix has <a href=# rel=nofollow>released</a>&nbsp;a documentary titled, "In The Name of God: A Holy Betrayal," which premiered on March 3. The docu-series revealed the exploitation of cult leaders in Korea.</p><img id=article_img_637145 title="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/1409791524.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/637145/dkz-kyoungyoon-confesses-involvement-with-jms-cult-heres-what-he-said.png alt="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>(Photo : Dispatch)</p><p>Amid the show's popularity, the K-pop community was taken aback upon learning Kyoungyoon and his family's alleged inclusion with the cult. In the docu-series, it has come to light that the cafe Kyoungyoon's family ran was also connected to a nearby church under JMS known as Youngduk Ju Mideum (Youngduk Trust In God).</p><p>The interview started with Dispatch having asked Kyoungyoon which church Kyoungyoon and his family were affiliated with. Kyoungyoon replied that they were indeed drawn in JMS's Providence Church.</p><img id=article_img_637143 title="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/1409791524.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/637143/dkz-kyoungyoon-confesses-involvement-with-jms-cult-heres-what-he-said.jpg alt="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>(Photo : Dispatch)</p><p>Kyoungyoon also shared that her mother had attended a Presbyterian church before. However, in 1994, she was led to JMS's Providence Church, as well as Kyoungyoon's aunt who studied theology and became a pastor.</p><p>In February 2020, Kyoungyoon's aunt opened her own church, which was linked to the café of Kyoungyoon's mother. With the revelations in hand, rumors started to spread like wildfire, only to be confirmed by Kyoungyoon on Dispatch.</p><img id=article_img_637144 title="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/1409791524.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/637144/dkz-kyoungyoon-confesses-involvement-with-jms-cult-heres-what-he-said.jpg alt="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>(Photo : Dispatch)</p><p>"I was a part of the Providence Church ever since I was in my mother's womb. At such a young age, I was already going with her. I went wherever she would go."</p><h2><strong>How Did Kyoungyoon End Up Joining JMS?</strong></h2><p>Kyoungyoon then explained how he joined JMS and how he left. The idol was exposed through the church's sermons and his aunt's praises over the church's leader, Jung Myung Seok. Kyoungyoon stated he has also seen "In the Name of God: A Holy Betrayal," expressing his disbelief and admitted how he was "brainwashed" slowly but surely.</p><p>The idol recalled a difficult time when he felt unwell on his head. To mend the sickness, several pastors who were his aunt's connections came to pray for him. Afterwards, Kyoungyoon went through surgery and found nothing serious, leading his mother to be ingrained further with the church.</p><img id=article_img_637146 title="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/1409791524.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/637146/dkz-kyoungyoon-confesses-involvement-with-jms-cult-heres-what-he-said.jpg alt="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>(Photo : Dispatch)</p><p>"When I went in for surgery three days after the pastors visited, there was nothing wrong with me. After my mother realized that that was God's doing, she began to have a lot more faith in JMS and began sharing the reality of healing stories."</p><p>Moving onwards, the topic pointed out to Wolmyeong-dong, where the Providence Church's headquarters was stationed. In relation to the place, Kyoungyoon has previously <a href=# rel=nofollow>mentioned</a>&nbsp;a painting of his during a live broadcast, which concerned many netizens.</p><img id=article_img_637147 title="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/1409791524.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/637147/dkz-kyoungyoon-confesses-involvement-with-jms-cult-heres-what-he-said.png alt="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>(Photo : Dispatch)</p><p>Kyoungyoon revealed that his parents would take him there, with the purpose of doing recreational activities such as swimming, volleyball, eating food and more. Regardless of the fun activities, Kyoungyoon was unaware of the "sexual exploitation" part.</p><p><strong>"Sexual exploitation? I was unaware that was taking place. We, who traveled to Wolmyeong-dong from the countryside, had no idea what had occurred,"</strong>&nbsp;Kyoungyoon stated.</p><h2><strong>Kyoungyoon Reveals His Activities During His Time With JMS, Vows To Leave Church</strong></h2><p>According to Dispatch's report, Kyoungyoon was also asked if he was ever active in JMS's activities. Kyoungyoon enumerated that various groups related to music were in the church. From hip-hop to singing groups.</p><p>The idol shared that he applied on its singing club during his ninth grade, and was invited in a group chatroom called Naver Band, after passing the audition. Kyoungyoon claimed the chatroom was utilized for assigning homework and other group endeavors.</p><img id=article_img_637148 title="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/1409791524.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/637148/dkz-kyoungyoon-confesses-involvement-with-jms-cult-heres-what-he-said.jpg alt="DKZ Kyoungyoon Confesses Involvement With JMS Cult — Here's What He Said" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>(Photo : Dispatch)</p><p>During his ninth and tenth grade, Kyoungyoon was active on the singing club. He also claimed there were no actual performances that occurred, and that JMS had allegedly used teenagers to perform missionary work.</p><p>Dispatch then asked why the idol had attended a JMS-affiliated church despite its leader, Jung Myung-seok, being behind bars between 2008 to 2018.</p><p>Kyoungyoon stated:</p><p>"I've been told since I was a child that JMS was wrongly accused of his crimes. There are numerous explanations taught to us how he was innocent."</p><p>"They essentially forced us to accept such justifications. Thus, gradually, we were all misled into believing that JMS had experienced persecution similar to what Jesus had."</p><p>"I experienced bullying as a child because I followed a pseudo-religion. Without even realizing it, I developed a guarded personality and identified myself a Christian when someone inquired about my faith."</p><p>"However, we all had faith in God. I have never brought up JMS to my colleagues, agency, or anybody else."</p><p>Kyoungyoon added, <strong>"I am terminating my involvement with the church at this point, even though it is already too late."</strong></p><p>What are your thoughts on this?</p><p>Read KpopStarz for more K-pop news.</p><h4>Sources: (<a href=# rel=nofollow>1</a>) (<a href=# rel=nofollow>2</a>) (<a href=# rel=nofollow>3</a>)<br>IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: <a href=#>DKZ Sees 40 Times Increase in First-Day Sales Compared to Their Previous Record</a></h4><p>KpopStarz owns this article</p><p>Written by Israel Monte</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rLzOqaqtmaKve6S7zGiYq6yZmLmmv45saGpuaWx8c3yRbGdsaWNksazGjKSwqK2enMawu81moKeun6HDprnEp6tmop2oeqTBy61loayd</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdkz-kyoungyoon-involvement-jms-cult-htm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdkz-kyoungyoon-involvement-jms-cult-htm.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdkz-kyoungyoon-involvement-jms-cult-htm.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdkz-kyoungyoon-involvement-jms-cult-htm.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdkz-kyoungyoon-involvement-jms-cult-htm.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdkz-kyoungyoon-involvement-jms-cult-htm.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./natasha-hamilton-husband-meet-charles-gay.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./natasha-hamilton-husband-meet-charles-gay.html>Natasha Hamilton Husband: Meet Charles Gay</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./denise-gordy.html>Denise Gordy- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./denise-gordy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
