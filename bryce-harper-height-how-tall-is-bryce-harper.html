He had a 6-for-6 performance with four home runs, a triple, and a double in the second game.</p><p>Home plate umpire Don Gilmore dismissed Harper from a National Junior College World Series game on June 2 of that year for questioning a called third strike.</p><p>As he departed the plate, Harper evidently wanted to indicate where he thought the pitch was by drawing a line in the ground with his bat. Harper received a two-game ban as a result of his second ejection of the season.</p><p>Southern Nevada lost the game in which Harper was disqualified, and the ban put an end to his amateur career. The group lost their subsequent game while Harper was out of the lineup, eliminating them from the competition.</p><p>The Golden Spikes Award, given annually to the finest amateur baseball player in the country, went to Harper in 2010.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bryce Harper career</h2><p>Bryce Harper is one if the most famous athletes in baseball and right fielder for the Major League Baseball (MLB) Philadelphia Phillies. Harper played with the Washington Nationals from 2012 to 2018 before moving to Philadelphia.</p><p>Harper, one of the most highly anticipated draft picks in recent memory, has been called a “five-tool player.” He transferred to the College of Southern Nevada after his sophomore year of Las Vegas High School, where he received the 2010 Golden Spikes Award.</p><p>In the 2010 MLB Draft, the Nationals picked Harper with the first overall pick. On April 28, 2012, at the age of 19, he made his MLB debut with the Nationals.</p><p>Being the youngest position player to participate in an All-Star Game, Harper was chosen for the 2012 All-Star Game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Harper shared the NL lead in home runs in 2015 and won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award in 2012.</p><p>He was selected as the National League Most Valuable Player for 2015 by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, and at the age of 22, he became the youngest MLB player to receive the honor.</p><p>He signed a 13-year, $330 million deal with the Phillies as a free agency during the 2018–19 offseason, which at the time was the most expensive deal ever in North American sports before being surpassed shortly after by Mike Trout.</p><p>With the Phillies, he earned the NL MVP award for the second time in 2021. The Phillies won their first pennant since 2009 thanks in large part to his leadership the following season, and he was named the NLCS MVP in the process.
