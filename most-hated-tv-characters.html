He reveled in the suffering of others and took pleasure in wielding power over those weaker than him. The combination of his sadistic behavior, coupled with his lack of empathy, made <b>Ramsay Bolton</b> a truly detested figure.</p><p>Despite his reign of terror on the small screen, Iwan Rheon’s portrayal of Ramsay Bolton was undeniably compelling.
