The first thing you should do is to take a look at your network. Login to your router and look to see what devices it's connected to. You should have already set up a username/password for your router.</p><h2>Can my next door neighbor use my WiFi?</h2>If you want the direct and simple answer, it's illegal to use your neighbor's Internet service without their consent, period. Your neighbor is paying for the service and if you are using it without their knowledge, it's stealing.<h2>How do I stop my Neighbour using my internet?</h2><p>Block unauthorized Wi-Fi access</p><li>Change your passwords.

Your router hosts your Wi-Fi network, so it has the most accurate data about which devices are connected to it. Most of the best routers offer a way to view a list of connected devices, although some may not.<h2>Can you block neighbors Wi-Fi signal?</h2>There are two ways to go about blocking your neighbor's WiFi. Method 1: You can either block their WiFi name and put it on a “Blacklist” so their WiFi name won't appear in your WiFi list. This is a good method if you just need to block one or two names. Method 2: You can create a WiFi “Whitelist”.<h2>How do I prevent others from using my Wi-Fi?</h2><p>To set up access control:</p><li>Launch a web browser from a computer or mobile device that is connected to your router's network.</li><li>Enter the router user name and password. ...</li><li>Select ADVANCED > Security > Access Control.</li><li>Select the Turn on Access Control check box.</li><h2>Can someone use my Wi-Fi without me knowing?</h2>Every device connected to your network has a unique IP address and MAC address, so you can see a list of connected devices. Many devices broadcast an ID because they've been named by their owners (i.e., "John's Laptop") so if you see one connected that you don't recognize, someone is stealing your WiFi.<h2>Can you tell if someone is stealing your Wi-Fi?</h2>If you only have a few Wi-Fi devices in your house, you may want to unplug or turn them all off and then watch the wireless signal light on your router. If the light continues to flicker, someone else is using your Wi-Fi.<h2>How do I identify an unknown device on my network?</h2><p>How to manually identify unknown devices on a network</p><li>Open the Command prompt or Terminal in your Windows, Linux, or macOS system.</li><li>Search all the network settings, such as default gateway and IP address, through the command prompt.</li><li>Type the command "arp -a" to view the list of all IP addresses connected to your network.</li><h2>How do I control devices connected to my WiFi?</h2><p>Here's how:</p><li>Sign in to Smart Home Manager.</li><li>Choose Network, then Connected Devices. Only devices connected to your network will show.</li><li>Select the device you want to view. Then, choose the more option (three dots). From here you can: Edit device details. Add the device to a profile. Block the device from your network.</li><h2>How do I remove devices connected to my WiFi?</h2>An easy way to kick out unauthorized devices from your network is to simply change your wifi password. This will forcibly disconnect all devices from the network, so you will have to sign in again with the new password on all of your devices.<h2>How can I tell if someone is piggybacking my Internet connection?</h2>Check the lights on your router<p>A quick way to see if you have freeloaders is to turn off all your wireless devices and see if the light is still blinking. If it is, someone else is on your network.</p><h2>How do I see how many people are connected to my WiFi converge?</h2>Enter your router's admin password and tap the LOGIN button. The dashboard displays. Swipe up on the network information panel. The devices that are connected to your router display.<h2>How can I tell what device is at an IP address?</h2>You can follow a path to a device if you know its IP address by using the tracert command at the command prompt (cmd). Open a Command Prompt window and type in tracert followed by the IP address that you know. The output will show each router that has a connection to that device will pass through.<h2>Who is on my Wi-Fi?</h2>How Can I Detect Who Is on My WiFi? By far the simplest way how you can answer yourself the question “Who's on my WiFi?” is by checking your router's logs. Virtually all routers keep some sort of a record of past and current connections, usually stating both the IP address of every connected device and its name.<h2>How do you check WiFi history?</h2><p>How Do I Check My Wi-Fi Router History?</p><li>Log into your router via your web browser.</li><li>Click Advanced.
