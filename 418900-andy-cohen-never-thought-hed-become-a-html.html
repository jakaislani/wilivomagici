He's a dad to two kids, a role he cherishes. He often shares his fatherhood journey with his social media fans; some think one of his children is a spitting image of him.</p><p class=Zg>His journey into fatherhood began with a whirlwind of emotions and anticipation. In December 2018, Cohen dropped a bombshell on his show that he was expecting his first child via surrogate in just six weeks. He was over the moon and couldn't wait to start his family. He expressed that family was his heart's deepest desire, and he expressed gratitude to the surrogate carrying his future.</p><p class=Zg>Cohen was excited to become a father for the first time. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BrozLRFlUcy/>told</a> his viewers, "Family means everything to me, and having one of my own is something I've wanted in my heart for my entire life." Despite the journey taking longer than usual, he was excited about what he believed would be the most fulfilling chapter of his life.</p><p class=Zg>A pivotal moment in Cohen's journey to fatherhood came during a summer lunch break at the "Southern Charm" reunion shoot. His surrogate sent him a video of the first sonogram, moving him to tears. A few weeks before the birth, Cohen disclosed the baby's gender to his longtime friend <a class="zd d" href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>.</p><p class=Zg>He also <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/AC360/status/1079912337610395648>revealed</a>, "When I was growing up, I never thought it would be possible as a gay man to grow up and have a family." Six weeks after the announcement, <a class="zd d" href=#>Benjamin Allen Cohen</a> came into the world. In February 2019, Cohen and his newborn son graced the pages of People's magazine.</p><p class=Zg>The new father opened up about the transformative experience of becoming a dad and the unforgettable moment he first met his baby boy, born on February 4, 2019, via surrogate. Cohen vividly recalled being in the delivery room, hoping his son would have a full head of hair. To his amusement, his son exceeded his expectations.</p><p class=Zg>His son's hair was the first thing he noticed, leaving him in awe. The first-time father cut the umbilical cord himself and held his son skin-to-skin. Sharing a cherished memory, he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-son-benjamin-first-photos-people-cover/>reminisced</a>, "He was so alert for the first two hours. His eyes were wide open. He didn't cry; he was just calm."</p><p class=Zg>Cohen's path to fatherhood was guided by an organization that connected him with an egg donor and a surrogate. He expressed gratitude for his California-based surrogate and voiced concern about the legal restrictions on surrogacy in some American states. The embryo that would become Benjamin was placed in his surrogate just before Cohen's 50th birthday.</p><p class=Zg>The process was smooth, and Cohen was open to having either a boy or a girl as long as the baby was healthy. Cohen, who became a parent later in life than most, felt a sense of calm he didn't have in his younger years. He anticipated being a strict but fair dad, not wanting to hover over his child unnecessarily, causing them and himself stress.</p><p class=Zg>But as he admitted, stress is part of the parenting package. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Benjamin was just over a year old. Despite the challenges, Cohen found silver linings in the situation. He cherished the extra time he spent with his toddler and discovered new activities for them to enjoy together.</p><p class=Zg>One of these was taking Benjamin out for walks, a simple pleasure that he found incredibly sweet. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-son-benjamin-love-walks-exclusive/>said</a>, "He's walking now in a way that I can take him out on the street for walks, so that's a totally new thing." As Benjamin turned two, Cohen noticed a shift in his hangouts with his friend, Cooper.</p><p class=Zg>Their children's budding friendship brought a new dimension to their meetings. Every weekend, they would visit each other, filling the time between their kids' naps. The sight of their children playing together delighted them. When they arrived, and Cooper's son Wyatt was still sleeping, Cooper would ask if Benjamin wanted to wake Wyatt up with him.</p><p class=Zg>Benjamin's <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-son-ben-playdates-anderson-cooper-son-wyatt-exclusive/>enthusiastic</a> "Yes" and the subsequent waking up ritual, complete with a hug and a kiss from Benjamin to Wyatt, was a moment Cohen found particularly endearing. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-son-ben-playdates-anderson-cooper-son-wyatt-exclusive/>gushed</a>, "It's really cute. We're just always amazed." In September 2020, Benjamin and Wyatt met in person for the first time since the pandemic began.</p><p class=Zg>They had previously met virtually back in June, on Father's Day. In April 2022, Cohen's family grew by one more. He announced the arrival of his daughter, <a class="zd d" href=#>Lucy Eve Cohen</a>, on Instagram. The post featured a heartwarming photo of the newborn snuggled up to his chest, his face beaming with joy, and a caption that <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc84M6ZJKAz/>read</a>, "HERE'S LUCY!"</p><p class=Zg>He expressed his gratitude to his surrogate and everyone who was involved in the birth of <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGXjNSuKRW/>his daughter</a>. Becoming a parent had a profound impact on Cohen. In an interview with People magazine, he shared how <a class="zd d" href=#>his priorities</a> had shifted since having children. He found himself choosing to stay home with them more than ever.</p><p class=Zg>He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-total-shift-priority-becoming-dad-two-exclusive/>said</a>, "I was not someone who ever stayed at home, so my priorities have just totally changed." His life, once filled with social events and work commitments, was now centered around his children. Being a single parent, Cohen understood the importance of a support system. He advised others in similar situations to ensure they have help.</p><p class=Zg>The arrival of his second child, Lucy, presented new challenges, the biggest of which was time management. Cohen spoke about the balancing act of spending quality time with both Benjamin and Lucy. He wanted to be there for them, to let them see him, hear his voice, and feel his presence.</p><p class=Zg>Managing his time between his two children is an integral part of his journey as a parent. "Fatherhood, it's changed my life in every way," He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/07/02/andy-cohen-son-fatherhood-benjamin-more-kids-interview/>admits</a>. The <a class="zd d" href=#>father of two</a> reveals that he still has three embryos left and has devised an <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.eonline.com/news/1333745/andy-cohen-says-his-kids-can-use-his-embryos-in-the-future-and-raise-their-siblings>unconventional idea</a> for their future use.</p><p class=Zg>In a conversation with his friend Jeff Lewis on SiriusXM's "Jeff Lewis Live," he expressed that he would be open to his children using these embryos to have their own children in the future if natural conception isn't an option for them. He humorously <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2022/06/07/andy-cohen-says-kids-can-defrost-raise-his-embryos-one-day/>suggested</a> they could "defrost their sibling and raise them."</p><p class=Zg>He also <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/andy-cohen-says-his-kids-can-use-remaining-embryos-when-theyre-older/>clarified</a> that even though they were delivered through different surrogates, his children are "biological siblings," sharing the same egg donor and his sperm. In September 2020, <a class="zd d" href=#>Andy Cohen</a> shared a special moment with his fans. He posted a side-by-side photo of himself as a young boy and his son, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXbhyTBLC-/>captioning</a> it, "Twinning with Ben."</p><p class=Zg>The resemblance between father and son was uncanny, and fans quickly noticed. The comment section was flooded with reactions. Fans expressed their amazement with <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXbhyTBLC-/>comments</a> like, "He looks just like you." The sentiment was echoed by others, with one <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXbhyTBLC-/>writing</a>, "What a great resemblance." The <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXbhyTBLC-/>word</a> "Twins" popped up more than once, and one fan even <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXbhyTBLC-/>remarked</a>, "Like father like son."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1ocXFgZXqiusOyZJynmJq7brrEr5yrZaSdvLazx61koZ2UYq%2Bmr86mnGaZXp3Brrg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f418900-andy-cohen-never-thought-hed-become-a-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f418900-andy-cohen-never-thought-hed-become-a-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f418900-andy-cohen-never-thought-hed-become-a-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f418900-andy-cohen-never-thought-hed-become-a-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f418900-andy-cohen-never-thought-hed-become-a-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f418900-andy-cohen-never-thought-hed-become-a-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stephen-curry.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stephen-curry.html>Biography, NBA Legend, Golden State Warriors Guard</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./uswnts-mallory-swanson-still-coming-to-terms-with-world-cup-absence.html>USWNT's Mallory Swanson still coming to terms with World Cup absence</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./uswnts-mallory-swanson-still-coming-to-terms-with-world-cup-absence.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
