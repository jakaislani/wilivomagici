His zodiac sign is Virgo, and he is 13 years old. He is an American citizen. He shares a home with his family. Laurie Maybaum is his mother’s name. She serves as his manager and oversees his social media profiles, including Instagram and Twitter. Unfortunately, his father’s name isn’t known. He has an older sister, but her name is similarly unknown. He has, however, uploaded photos of himself and his family on his Instagram page.</p><p>He is devoted to his camera and refuses to part with it. In the future, he hopes to be a director. Similarly, “Batman” is his favorite superhero. He also enjoys playing basketball, spending time with his family on the beach, and socializing with his friends. He is, nevertheless, terrified of being alone in the dark. His educational background and qualifications are unknown at this time, as are the names of the educational institutions he attended.

He’s still far too young to be in a love relationship. Jaso, on the other hand, is more concerned with his work and studies than with being in a relationship. However, he now has a large number of admirers.

And it was one of the series’ key characters, and possibly the most notable of all of his performances. The show debuted on the “Disney Channel” on July 21, 2017, and is now in its second season.</p><p>This series earned him the prize for “Best Leading Young Actor – Television Series” at the 2018 “Young Entertainer Awards” ceremony.
